However, the CISO requires that the connections be protected by encryption using a standard VPN solution. Which of the following secure protocols can be used as a VPN? (Choose all that apply.)</p> <ul> <li>IPsec</li> <li>SSH</li> <li>TLS</li> </ul> <p>IPsec, SSH, and TLS are all able to be used as a VPN. While IPsec and TLS can be used as either transport mode or tunnel mode VPNs, SSH is limited to be used only as a transport mode VPN. The others are not VPN protocols. Kerberos offers a single sign-on solution for users and provides protection for logon credentials. Modern implementations of Kerberos use hybrid encryption to provide reliable authentication protection. Signal is a cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end encryption for voice communications, videoconferencing, and text message services. S-RPC (Secure Remote Procedure Call) is an authentication service and is simply a means to prevent unauthorized execution of code on remote systems.</p> </li> <li> <p>Administrators regularly back up sensitive data on servers within a data center. Security controls restrict access to the data center, and all systems that process sensitive information are marked. After backing up data, they send an unmarked copy to an unstaffed company warehouse for long-term storage. Recently, someone posted some of this data on the internet. Investigators determined much of the backup media is no longer in the warehouse. Which of the following administrator actions would have the best chance of preventing this incident?</p> <p>Mark the tapes before sending them to the warehouse.</p> <p>If the tapes were marked before they left the data center, employees would recognize their value, and it is more likely someone would challenge their storage in an unstaffed warehouse. Purging or degaussing the tapes before using them will erase previously held data but won\u2019t help if sensitive information is backed up to the tapes after they are purged or degaussed. Adding the tapes to an asset management database will help track them but wouldn\u2019t prevent this incident.</p> </li> <li> <p>Which of the following VPN protocols has always offered native data encryption?</p> <p>IPsec</p> <p>From this list of VPN protocols, only IPsec has always offered native data encryption. Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is a proprietary Cisco tunneling protocol that can be used to establish VPNs. GRE provides encapsulation but not encryption. L2TP does not offer native data encryption, but it can support IPsec\u2019s ESP to provide encryption. PPTP did not originally provide native data encryption, but with the adoption of MS-CHAPv2 that feature was added.</p> </li> <li> <p>A risk assessment includes the evaluation of threats for each identified asset.

What type of tool would best assist with this problem?</p> <p>Code repository</p> <p>The use of a code repository would provide a central location for the storage of code as well as version control to manage different releases. Integrated development environments (IDE) are tools used to improve the efficiency of individual programmers and do not assist with collaboration. Integrated product teams (IPTs) are a team organizational approach and not a development tool. Runtimes execute code on a system and are not development tools.</p> </li> <li> <p>What law protects the right of citizens to privacy by placing restrictions on the authority granted to government agencies to search private residences and facilities?</p> <p>Fourth Amendment</p> <p>The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution sets the \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard that law enforcement officers must follow when conducting searches and/or seizures of private property. It also states that those officers must obtain a warrant before gaining involuntary access to such property. The Privacy Act regulates what information government agencies may collect and maintain about individuals. The Second Amendment grants the right to keep and bear arms. The Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act regulates financial institutions, not the federal government.</p> </li> <li> <p>In today\u2019s business environment, prudence is mandatory. Showing due diligence and due care is the only way to disprove negligence in an occurrence of loss. Which of the following are true statements? (Choose all that apply.)</p> <ul> <li>Due diligence is establishing a plan, policy, and process to protect the interests of an organization.</li> <li>Due care is practicing the individual activities that maintain the security effort.</li> </ul> <p>Due diligence is establishing a plan, policy, and process to protect the interests of an organization. Due care is practicing the individual activities that maintain the security effort. The other options are incorrect, they have the terms inverted. The corrected statements are as follows: Due diligence is developing a formalized security structure containing a security policy, standards, baselines, guidelines, and procedures. Due care is the continued application of a security structure onto the IT infrastructure of an organization. Due diligence is knowing what should be done and planning for it. Due care is doing the right action at the right time.</p> </li> <li> <p>An organization wants to improve the security of their DNS operations by implementing DNSSEC. Which of the following is most important to support this new security mechanism?</p> <p>PKI </p> <p>DNSSEC uses certificates to perform mutual authentication between DNS servers, and thus public key infrastructure (PKI) is needed to provide and support those certificates. HTTPS is not involved in DNSSEC but is the basis for DoH. A hardware security module (HSM) is not used in DNSSEC. LDAPS is not related to DNSSEC.</p> </li> <li> <p>An administrator has been tasked with reviewing the Human Resources server log files looking for malicious activity. Which of the following identifies the purpose of this activity?</p> <p>Accountability</p> <p>Accountability is possible by reviewing logs and tracking user activity. Accountability depends on strong identification and authentication methods, but reviewing logs doesn\u2019t provide identification or authentication. Audit trails are the entire body of data gathered by event logging.</p> </li> <li> <p>Third-party governance is the system of external entity oversight that may be mandated by law, regulation, industry standards, contractual obligation, or licensing requirements. Often third-party assessment is necessary to evaluate the security of a supply chain. Which of the following means of third-party assessment is used to interview personnel and observe their operating habits?</p> <p>On-site assessment</p> <p>An on-site assessment is a third-party assessment tool where auditors visit the site of the organization to interview personnel and observe their operating habits. Document exchange and review is a mechanism to investigate the means by which datasets and documentation are exchanged as well as the formal processes by which they perform assessments and reviews. Process/policy review is a mechanism that requests copies of their security policies, processes/procedures, and documentation of incidents and responses for review. A third-party audit is performed by a third party, such as defined by AICPA (the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants), to provide an unbiased review of an entity\u2019s security infrastructure.</p> </li> <li> <p>No one control can protect against all possible threats. Using a multilayered solution allows for numerous, different controls to guard against whatever threats come to pass. Which of the following is the most important and distinctive concept in relation to layered security?</p> <p>Series</p> <p>Layering is the deployment of multiple security mechanisms in a series. When security restrictions are performed in a series, they are performed one after the other in a linear fashion. Therefore, a single failure of a security control does not render the entire solution ineffective. Multiple security controls are only important so you can use them in a series, rather than have only one protection. Parallel is no better than a single protection. Filtering is a common feature of many security measures, such as firewalls, but it is not an essential element of layered security.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your organization has a strictly enforced email security policy which prohibits messages lacking proof of source and lacking non-repudiation. However, you have received a message which fails to meet these requirements and notice several other concerning characteristics. Which of the following are indicators that this message is a hoax? (Select three.)</p> <p>A. Lack of a digital signature verifying the origin</p> <p>D. Threat of damage to your computer system</p> <p>E. Encouragement to take specific steps to resolve a concern which are not based on standard company procedures</p> <p>A hoax is a social engineering attack that is attempting to trick a user into taking actions that will harm them through the use of fear that not taking action would actually cause harm. A hoax will not have a digital signature from a verifiable origin, so its source is questionable. Hoaxes often use the threat of damage or harm to encourage the victim to take action, and those actions are often provided steps that will actually cause the victim harm. (B) Poor grammar, (C) bad spelling, and (G) hyperlinks in the message are all characteristics of both valid and invalid email messages. (F) Claiming to be from a trusted authority is the attempt to use the social engineering principle of authority and/or intimidation, which is not uniquely a feature of a hoax, but many SPAM, BEC, phishing attacks do as well. But the claim of being a trusted authority could also be valid as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>The CISO has put you in charge of improving the security awareness and training program. The concern they want you to focus on is that it is unknown whether the training efforts are having any affect or benefit. If you cannot establish proof of a positive ROSI, then the program will be terminated. Which of the following would be useful in establishing an effectiveness evaluation procedure? (Choose all that apply.)</p> <p>B. Administering a quiz immediately after the awareness event</p> <p>D. Have workers take a test 6 months after a training class</p> <p>E. Collect key security indicators that relate to insider security incidents over time</p> <p>Training and awareness program effectiveness evaluation should take place on an ongoing or continuous basis. This can often include administering a quiz or exam immediately after an awareness or training event and a follow-up quiz/exam months later. Also, event and incident logs should be reviewed for the rate of occurrences of security violations due to employee actions and behaviors to see if there is any noticeable difference in the rate of occurrence or trends of incidents before and after a training presentation. The other options are not useful for training program effectiveness evaluation. (A) Never assume that just because a worker was marked as attending or completing a training event that they actually learned anything or will be changing their behavior. (C) Forcing employees to pay a fine for each security infraction is not a means to assess effectiveness; it is a crude means to force compliance. (F) Posting a list of employees who cause a security incident is not a means to assess effectiveness; it is a mechanism of using shame to force compliance and it is not an ethical practice.</p> </li> <li> <p>Patricia recently discovered that passwords to systems and user accounts belonging to her organization were for sale on the dark web. She believes that she knows the individual who stole and is selling those passwords and wishes to contact law enforcement. What law has most likely been violated?</p> <p>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act</p> <p>The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) explicitly covers trafficking in passwords. This is the activity that Patricia discovered and she could refer the matter for possible federal prosecution. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) protects against eavesdropping on electronic communications.

He is reviewing the security of student educational records and want to ensure that his college is compliant with all relevant laws and regulations. What law protects the privacy rights of students?</p> <p>FERPA</p> <p>The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the rights of students and the parents of minor students. The Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act (GLBA) covers the customer records of financial institutions, whereas the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulates healthcare providers. The Sarbanes\u2013Oxley (SOX) Act governs the financial records of publicly traded companies.</p> </li> <li> <p>An organization plans to donate several older computers to a local school. Chad will sanitize the hard drives in these computers. Which of the following methods is Chad most likely to use?</p> <p>Purging</p> <p>Purging media removes all data by writing over existing data multiple times to ensure that the data is not recoverable using any known methods. Purged media can then be reused in less secure environments. Erasing the media performs a delete, but the data remains and can easily be restored. Clearing, or overwriting, writes unclassified data over existing data, but some sophisticated forensics techniques may be able to recover the original data, so this method should not be used to reduce the classification of media.</p> </li> <li> <p>A small business is planning to outsource payroll. This requires the business to pass some data to the payroll company to handle payroll functions. In this scenario, which of the following roles best describes the payroll company?</p> <p>Data processor</p> <p>The payroll company is fulfilling the role of data processor by processing the payroll data. The data controller identifies what data to pass to the data processor and how that data should be processed. A data subject is like a data user and simply accesses data. A data custodian is responsible for the day-to-day maintenance of data.</p> </li> <li> <p>You need to identify a method to embed unobtrusive labels in digital data. After they are embedded, other methods should be able to detect these labels. Which of the following is the best choice to meet these requirements?</p> <p>Watermarking</p> <p>Digital watermarking places labels or marking in files (digital data). Other methods, such as data loss prevention (DLP) and digital rights management (DRM), can detect the labels. Remanence refers to data left on media after it should have been removed. A digital signature is used in emails to validate the sender\u2019s identity. Encryption scrambles data so that it is unreadable, but it doesn\u2019t add labels.</p> </li> <li> <p>An organization is decommissioning several older computers and replacing them with new ones. The CIO wants to ensure that data remanence is not a problem with the disk drives within these computers. Which of the following methods will most likely result in data remanence?</p> <p>Erasing</p> <p>Erasing data on a hard disk drive is likely to leave some data on a hard disk drive, also known as data remanence. Clearing (sometimes called overwriting) overwrites the disk drive with different bits in three separate passes. Purging is a more intense method of clearing the disk and repeats the clearing process multiple times. Cryptoshredding deletes encryption keys, but the question doesn\u2019t indicate data is encrypted.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your company is planning to launch an e-commerce website. Management wants to ensure this website has adequate security controls in place before the site goes live. Administrators started with a baseline of security controls. What else should be a primary consideration related to security controls?</p> <p>Selecting a standard</p> <p>Standards selection refers to adding security controls based on external standards. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is an example of an external standard, and it mandates the use of several specific controls. The identification of the data controller and data processor isn\u2019t related to the selection of security controls. Data loss prevention methods attempt to prevent data from leaving a network but are less of a concern on a public-facing e-commerce server.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your organization has a database that includes residents of the EU. Management wants to transfer this to a third party for research and aggregation, but they want to modify the data so it can be transferred without GDPR compliance problems. Which of the following techniques will meet these requirements?</p> <p>Anonymization</p> <p>Anonymization techniques remove all data so that it is difficult to identify the original identities. When done correctly, the GDPR no longer applies. Pseudonymization is the process of replacing some data with an identifier, such as a pseudonym. An external dataset holds the original data along with the pseudonym. However, if applying pseudonymization techniques, the GDPR still applies. Tokenization replaces some data with tokens or aliases. A third party typically keeps the original data along with the token.</p> </li> <li> <p>What is the maximum key length supported by the Advanced Encryption Standard\u2019s Rijndael encryption algorithm?</p> <p>256 bits</p> <p>The AES/Rijndael algorithm is capable of operating with 128-, 192-, or 256-bit keys. The algorithm uses a block size equal to the length of the key.</p> </li> <li> <p>What protocol replaces certificate revocation lists with a real-time method of verifying the status of a digital certificate?</p> <p>OCSP</p> <p>The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) provides real-time query/response services to digital certificate users. This overcomes the latency inherent in the traditional certificate revocation list download and cross-check process. Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) is an authentication protocol used in WPA3 wireless networking. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a directory services protocol. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used to establish network routes.</p> </li> <li> <p>You are deploying a new product into the production environment. It is a self-contained next-generation firewall (NGFW), which should be able to filter unwanted traffic by keyword, application, and protocol. You position the new device between the client network segment and the server network segment. However, once it is installed, users report that they can no longer access company servers or the internet. What is the potential cause of this issue?</p> <p>The new device has secure defaults.</p> <p>This scenario\u2019s problems are caused by the new device having secure defaults. This is a common problem with security products\u2014they are often configured with strong security defaults so that adjustments must be made to allow for typical communications and operations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Security needs to be designed, architectured, engineered, integrated, and implemented in order to be reliable and cost-effective. There are numerous security design principles that can be adopted and woven into the crafting of company policies as well as deployed solutions. Which of the following are considered secure design principles? (Choose all that apply.)</p> <p>B. Least privilege</p> <p>C. Secure defaults</p> <p>D. Fail securely</p> <p>F. Threat modeling</p> <p>G. Keep it simple</p> <p>I. Separation of duties</p> <p>J. Zero trust</p> <p>K. Privacy by design</p> <p>The standard secure design principles are: least privilege, secure defaults, fail securely, threat modeling, keep it simple, separation of duties, zero trust, and privacy by design. The not listed but also secure design principles are defense in depth and trust but verify. The other options are incorrect. \u201cPeople are the weakest link\u201d is not a secure design principle and is also not accurate. Although people can cause security breaches intentionally, accidentally, or via coercion, they are also a key component in a successful security solution. \u201cSecurity is always top priority\u201d is not a secure design principle. Security should always be limited by business objectives. The most secure solution may interfere with a mission-critical business function, so security must support the business rather than get in the way of it. \u201cRisk should be eliminated\u201d is not a secure design principle and is false. All risk cannot be eliminated. There may be some individual risks that can be eliminated, but in most circumstances risk reduction, management (i.e., deterrence, transfer, avoidance), or acceptance are the only real options.</p> </li> <li> <p>An industrial processing facility has implemented SCADA systems to monitor and manage the mission-critical production lines. These ICSs cannot adhere to the company\u2019s 14-day patch application policy. How can these systems be secured in order to minimize malware infection?</p> <p>Prohibit nonauthorized nonessential software from executing</p> <p>In this scenario, the best option is to prohibit nonauthorized nonessential software from executing. A software firewall might limit network communication sessions, but will not necessarily reduce the risk of malware traversing a network link. Deployment in a screened subnet is not a good option as it may expose the ICS to the internet; deployment in a private network segment or an air-gapped network would be a better option. An IDS would only notify about a breach or intrusion or malware infection after it occurred, but an IPS might be a reasonable option.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your organization has decided to update their IT environment to take advantage of advancements in virtualization solutions. They are primarily focused on containerization products. Which of the following are features or capabilities of some containerization solutions? (Choose all that apply.)</p> <p>B. Allow for multiple concurrent applications within a single container</p> <p>D. Offer customization of interaction between applications in separate containers</p> <p>Containerization or OS virtualization is based on the concept of eliminating the duplication of OS elements in a virtual machine. Some containerization solutions allow for multiple concurrent applications withing a single container, whereas others are limited to one per container. Many containerization solutions allow for customization of how much interaction applications in separate containers is allowed. The other options are incorrect. A virtual machine\u2013based system uses a hypervisor installed onto the bare metal of the host server and then operates a full guest OS within each virtual machine, and each virtual machine often supports only a single primary application. Software-defined visibility (SDV) is a framework to automate the processes of network monitoring and response.</p> </li> <li> <p>Which of the following is typically not a culprit in causing damage to computer equipment in the event of a fire and a triggered suppression?</p> <p>Light</p> <p>Light is usually not damaging to most computer equipment, but fire, smoke, and the suppression medium (typically water) are very destructive.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your facility has just been upgraded with a new burglar alarm system. This intrusion monitoring mechanism is able to detect both perimeter breaches as well as internal movement. Which of the following is not a typical type of alarm that can be triggered for physical security?</p> <p>A. Preventive</p> <p>There is no such thing as a preventive alarm. Alarms are triggered in response to a detected intrusion or attack. Whenever a motion detector registers a significant or meaningful change in the environment, it triggers an alarm. Common types of alarms include deterrent, repellent, and notification.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your organization is considering an upgrade of the internal network to support IPv6. You have been asked to provide an evaluation of the benefits and drawbacks of this project. Which of the following are true in regard to IPv6? (Choose all that apply.)</p> <p>B. Uses 16-byte addresses</p> <p>D. Supports autoconfiguration without DHCP</p> <p>F. Supports Quality of Service (QoS) priority values</p> <p>IPv6 uses 16-byte (128-bit) addresses, supports autoconfiguration without DHCP, and supports Quality of Service (QoS) priority values. IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, reserves an entire subnet (127.0.0.1\u2013127.255.255.254) for loopback, and requires NAT to convert between internal and external addresses. IPv4 also supports QoS priority values, but it is called \u201ctype of service\u201d in the IPv4 header.</p> </li> <li> <p>Xavier has been tasked with redesigning the network in order to minimize the risk related to users in one department accessing the systems in another. Which of the following is not used to segment a network?</p> <p>VPN</p> <p>A VPN is not a network segmentation; it is a secured encapsulation tunnel used to connect networks (or network segments) together. Screened subnets, VLANs, and an internal segmentation firewalls (ISFW) are used to segment a network.</p> </li> <li> <p>Which of the following are technologies specifically defined as part of 802.11 wireless networking? (Choose all that apply.)</p> <p>B. WPA3</p> <p>C. SAE</p> <p>D. 802.11i</p> <p>E. WPS</p> <p>WPA3, 802.11i, SAE, and WPS are all technologies that are specifically defined as part of wireless networking. 802.1X is an IEEE standard for port authentication, which is not strictly related to wireless use. It is, however, the basis of the ENT (enterprise) authentication option on wireless networks, but it is widely used to manage authentication throughout a wired network as well.</p> </li> <li> <p>A worker reports that they are unable to access an internal web application from their workstation. After you confirm that the worker has been assigned correct authorization, you review the logs from the workstation for clues. You discover the following entries:</p> <p><code>2020-01-08 12:15:36 DROP TCP 192.168.6.104 192.168.255.255 443 ---------- RECEIVE</code></p> <p><code>2020-01-08 12:15:51 DROP UDP 192.168.6.104 192.168.255.255 443 ---------- RECEIVE</code></p> <p>Based on this information, which of the following should you adjust to address this situation?</p> <p>Host-based firewall</p> <p>These log items are from a firewall log. They indicate that TCP and UDP traffic from the 192.168.x.x subnet to the workstation was dropped. Since this log is from the workstation, this indicates that there is a bad rule in the host-based firewall that is blocking all communications to the workstation from the local subnet. </p> </li> <li> <p>While performing a risk assessment, you need to create a list of threats. You are focusing on email as an asset, but you then realize email can be used as a weapon as well. What is it called when email itself is used as an attack mechanism?</p> <p>Mail-bombing</p> <p>Mail-bombing is the use of email as an attack mechanism by flooding a system with messages, causing a denial of service. Masquerading is claiming to be someone or something else and is a form of spoofing. Spoofing is the falsification of the source of a communication, such as spoofing an IP address, email address, or MAC address. A Smurf attack is an ICMP-based DoS.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remi is evaluating several multimedia collaboration products for use in her company. She needs to determine which products provide the best solution for her organization\u2019s business objectives. The product will be used in-house as well as by remote workers using broadband internet services. Which of the following questions should she ask when evaluating each option? (Choose all that apply.)</p> <p>A. Does the communication occur across an open protocol or an encrypted tunnel?</p> <p>C. Does the service use strong authentication techniques?</p> <p>D. Are activities of users audited and logged?</p> <p>E. What tracking mechanisms are used, can the tracking be disabled, and what is the data collected for?</p> <p>Questions about minimum bandwidth requirements for chat and voice are likely unneeded since those services do not require much bandwidth and the remote users are all working over broadband internet services.</p> </li> <li> <p>Telecommuting is performing work at a remote location. Telecommuting clients use many remote access techniques to establish connectivity to the central office LAN. Which of the following are examples of a remote access techniques? (Choose all that apply.)</p> <p>A. Remote node operation</p> <p>C. Remote control</p> <p>E. Screen scraping</p> <p>F. Service specific</p> </li> <li> <p>A software company with a worldwide footprint recently bought out another software company based in the United States. The U.S. company needs to maintain its name and domain infrastructure. However, employees in both companies need to access resources in the other network. Which of the following would best meet this need?</p> <p>A federation</p> <p>A federation can include two or more networks and allow users in each network to share network resources. Federations provide single sign-on (SSO) capabilities, but SSO will not share network resources.</p> </li> <li> <p>A company\u2019s security policy states that user accounts should be disabled during the exit interview for any employee leaving the company. Which of the following is the most likely reason for this policy?</p> <p>To retain the decryption key</p> <p>The most likely reason (of the provided answers) is the retention of the account\u2019s decryption key. Data encrypted by a user is typically encrypted with a key tied to the user account, and deleting the account may result in the data staying encrypted and unavailable. Though not available as an option, disabling the account also prevents an employee from logging on after leaving the company. Disabling the account allows supervisors to review the user\u2019s data. Employees should return company property, but disabling an account won\u2019t ensure they do so. Disabling a user account won\u2019t terminate employee benefits.</p> </li> <li> <p>Network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) and network-based intrusion prevention systems (NIPSs) have some differences and some similarities. Which of the following describes a similarity?</p> <p>They can both detect attacks using pattern-matching</p> <p>NIDSs and NIPSs can both detect attacks using pattern-matching (also known as signature-based detection and knowledge-based detection). A NIPS is placed inline with traffic and can prevent attacks from reaching an internal network. While a NIDS can be placed inline with the traffic, it isn\u2019t placed inline by default. An IDS may be connected to a network switch port using mirror mode to collect data, but an NIPS would be inline with all traffic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tina is preparing to create a forensic image of a hard drive from a system involved in a security incident. What hardware device can she use to help ensure that creating the image does not alter the original evidence?</p> <p>Write blocker</p> <p>Write blockers are hardware devices used to prevent the accidental writing of data to media that was collected as evidence. Network taps and protocol analyzers are used in the collection of evidence from networks, rather than storage. Cryptographic hashes may be used to detect unauthorized changes to evidence, but they do not prevent those changes from occurring.</p> </li> <li> <p>Gene is reviewing the shared software libraries used within his organization. He notices that developers widely use open source libraries. Which of the following statements about these libraries are true? (Select all that apply)</p> <p>Open-source libraries should be tested for security vulnerabilities.</p> <p>Open-source library use within the organization should be tracked.</p> <p>Open-source libraries are commonly used by software developers and do not necessarily pose a higher risk than commercially available libraries. The use of these libraries should be tracked and subject to regular security testing, as should any other closed-source library use.</p> </li> </ol>"}, {"location": "CISSP%20Pre/1-Security%20and%20Risk%20Management/0-Overview/", "title": "Domain 1 Security and Risk Managment 16%", "text": ""}, {"location": "CISSP%20Pre/1-Security%20and%20Risk%20Management/0-Overview/#11-understand-adhere-to-and-promote-professional-ethics-2-4-items", "title": "1.1 Understand, adhere to, and promote professional ethics (2-4 items)", "text": "<p>Chapter 19</p>"}, {"location": "CISSP%20Pre/1-Security%20and%20Risk%20Management/0-Overview/#isc2-code-of-professional-ethics", "title": "ISC2 Code of Professional Ethics", "text": "<p>It's a simple code with a preamble and four canons.</p> <p>Code of Ethics Preamble - The safety and welfare of society and the common good, duty to our principlas, and to each other requires that we adhere, and be seen to adhere, to the highest ethical standards of behavior. - Therefore, strict adherence to this Code is a condition of certification.</p> <p>Code of Ethics Canons</p> <ol> <li> <p>Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure.</p> </li> <li> <p>Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally.</p> </li> <li> <p>Provide diligent and competent service to principals.</p> </li> <li> <p>Advance and protect the profession.</p> </li> </ol>"}, {"location": "CISSP%20Pre/1-Security%20and%20Risk%20Management/0-Overview/#organizational-code-of-ethics", "title": "Organizational code of ethics", "text": "<p>Almost every organization has its own code of ethics that is published to employees to help guide their everyday work.

Security helps to ensure that an organization is able to continue to exist and operate in spite of any attempts to steal its data or compromise its physical or logical element. Security should be viewed as an element of business management rather than an IT concern. Security is the business management tool that ensures the reliable and protected operation of IT/IS. Security exists to support the objectives, mission, and goals of the organization.</p> <p>How can an organization control its security?  Generally, a security framework should be adopted that provides a starting point for how to implement security.  1. Initiation 2. Finetuning through evaluation.     Three types of of security evaluation: risk assessment, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing.</p> <p>What are the features of security? 1. Security should be cost-effective. Thus, you should select security controls that provide the greatest protection for the lowest resource cost.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Security should be legally defensible. The laws of your jurisdiction are the backstop of organizational security. When intruders' activities are illegal, prosecution in court may be the only available response for compensation or closure.</p> </li> <li> <p>Since our deployed technology is changing by the passage of time, by the users, and by the adversaries discovering flaws and developing exploits. The defenses that were sufficient yesterday may not be sufficient tomorrow. As new vulnerabilities are discovered, as new means of attack are crafted and new exploits ae built, we have to respond by reassessing our security infrastructure and responding appropriately.</p> </li> </ol>"}, {"location": "CISSP%20Pre/1-Security%20and%20Risk%20Management/Chapter%201/#understand-and-apply-security-concepts", "title": "Understand and Apply Security Concepts", "text": ""}, {"location": "CISSP%20Pre/1-Security%20and%20Risk%20Management/Chapter%201/#the-cia-triad", "title": "The CIA Triad", "text": "<p>Confidentiality  Confidentiality protections prevent disclosure while protecting authorized access. Many unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information are the result of human error, oversight, or ineptitude. Confidentiality violations can result from the actions of an end user or a system administrator. They can also occur because of an oversight in a security policy or a misconfigured security control. Numerous countermeasures can help ensure confidentiality against possible threats. These include encryption, network traffic padding, strict access control, rigorous authentication procedures, data classification, and extensive personnel training.</p> <p>Organizations should evaluate the nuances of confidentiality they wish to enforce. Tools and technology that implement one form of confidentiality might not support or allow other forms.</p> <p>Integrity  Integrity is the concept of protecting the reliability and correctness of data. Integrity protection prevents unauthorized alterations of data.</p> <p>Numerous attacks focus on the violation of integrity. These include viruses, logic bombs, unauthorized access, errors in coding and applications, malicious modification, intentional replacement, and system backdoors.</p> <p>Availability  Availability means authorized subjecta are granted timely and uninterrupted access to object.
